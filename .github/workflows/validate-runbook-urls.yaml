# This workflow reads all runbook_url fields in alert rules and checks if they are valid URLs.
# If the URL starts with https://intranet.giantswarm.io/, it checks if the according file exists
# in the giantswarm/giantswarm repository.
# If the URL starts with https://handbook.giantswarm.io/, it checks if the according file exists
# in the giantswarm/handbook repository.
# Bad URLs should be annotated.
