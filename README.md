# Prometheus rules chart

**What is this app?**

This repository contains Giant Swarm alerting and recording rules



### Alerting

The alerting rules are located in `helm/prometheus-rules/templates/alerting-rules`

#### How alerts are structured

At Giant Swarm we follow some best practices to organize our alerts:

here is an example:

```yaml
  groups:
  - name: app
    rules:
    - alert: ManagementClusterAppFailedAtlas
        annotations:
            description: '{{`Management Cluster App {{ $labels.name }}, version {{ $labels.version }} is {{if $labels.status }} in {{ $labels.status }} state. {{else}} not installed. {{end}}`}}'
            opsrecipe: app-failed/
        expr: app_operator_app_info{status!~"(?i:(deployed|cordoned))", catalog=~"control-plane-.*",team="atlas"}
        for: 30m
        labels:
            area: managedservices
            cancel_if_cluster_status_creating: "true"
            cancel_if_cluster_status_deleting: "true"
            cancel_if_cluster_status_updating: "true"
            cancel_if_outside_working_hours: "true"
            severity: page
            sig: none
            team: atlas
```

Any Alert includes:

* A description
* An [opsrecipe](https://intranet.giantswarm.io/docs/support-and-ops/ops-recipes/) 
* Mandatory labels:
   - `area`
   - `team`
   - `severity`

* Optional labels:
   - `sig`
   - `cancel_if_.*`


#### Routing

Alertmanager does the routing based on the labels menitoned above.

* `severity=page` is sent to opsgenie

##### Opsgenie routing

Opsgenie routing is defined in the `Teams` section.

Opsgenie route alerts based on the `team` label.




### Recording rules

The recording rules are located `helm/prometheus-rules/templates/recording-rules`
