# {APP-NAME} chart

Giant Swarm offers a {APP-NAME} App which can be installed in workload clusters.
Here we define the {APP-NAME} chart with its templates and default configuration.

**What is this app?**
**Why did we add it?**
**Who can use it?**

## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

1. [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/app-platform/#installing-an-app)
2. [Using our API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/#operation/createClusterAppV5)
3. Directly creating the [App custom resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) on the management cluster.

## Configuring

### values.yaml
**This is an example of a values file you could upload using our web interface.**
```
# values.yaml

```

### Sample App CR and ConfigMap for the management cluster
If you have access to the Kubernetes API on the management cluster, you could create
the App CR and ConfigMap directly.

Here is an example that would install the app to
workload cluster `abc12`:

```
# appCR.yaml

```

```
# user-values-configmap.yaml


```

See our [full reference page on how to configure applications](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/app-configuration/) for more details.
